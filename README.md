Due to many underlying factors in our world, such as Covid-19 and online learning/working, there has been a decrease in mental wellbeing. This means that, although our quality of life has been increasing, overall happiness and good mental health has been on the decline
Therefore, it is important to take care of our mental health by tracking our daily habits using our application: “Level Up”!
Level Up is an application to help users keep track of their daily habits and health, such as weight, height, hours of sleep, number of meals, frequent rests/naps, and happiness.

In the application, the user must enter the date that they are completing form
The form contains these self-assessment questions that the user must enter truthfully for the program to assist them
At the end of the form, the user has two options:
  * The user can press the red “clear” button, which will clear/reset all the entries that they have entered
  * They can click the green “submit” form, which submits all their answers to the questions to a database
  * The database performs analytics and then forms a personalized message that tells whether the user should sleep more, eat more/eat less, take more naps/rests during the day,    and/or take some time off to de-stress and relax.
  * The form is wallpapered with a subtle sunset colour to try to lighten to mood (nice pun)
