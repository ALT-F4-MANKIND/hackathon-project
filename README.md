# hackathon-project
Due to many underlying factors in our world, such as Covid-19 and online learning/working, there has been a decrease in mental wellbeing. This means that, although our quality of life has been increasing, overall happiness and good mental health has been on the decline
Therefore, it is important to take care of our mental health by tracking our daily habits using our application: “Level Up”!
Level Up is an application to help users keep track of their daily habits and health, such as weight, height, hours of sleep, number of meals, frequent rests/naps, and happiness.

In the application, the user must enter the date that they are completing form
The form contains these self-assessment questions that the user must enter truthfully for the program to assist them
At the end of the form, the user has two options:
  * The user can press the red “clear” button, which will clear/reset all the entries that they have entered
  * They can click the green “submit” form, which submits all their answers to the questions to a database
  * The database performs analytics and then forms a personalized message that tells whether the user should sleep more, eat more/eat less, take more naps/rests during the day,    and/or take some time off to de-stress and relax.
  * The form is wallpapered with a subtle sunset colour to try to lighten to mood (which is a very nice pun)


Application
--
  * This application is run using Node.js
  * Front end
      * HTML, CSS
      * React, Bootstrap, Recharts 
  * Back end:
      * Firebase as the database

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
